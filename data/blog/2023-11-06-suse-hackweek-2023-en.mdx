## What's Hackweek?

Hack Week is the time SUSE employees experiment, innovate & learn interruption-free for a whole week! Across teams or alone, but always without limits.

A SUSE tradition since 2007, Hack Week has brought together hundreds of hackers around the globe to collaborate on open source. Learn more about Hack Week.

## Objectives for Hackweek 2023

- Set up a GitHub pages-hosted website
  - Don't use Jekyll as the generator; use something new, such as Next.js
  - It needs to have automated deployments
  - I will leverage an existing template I can customize and build upon
  - Use it to share my hack week progress
- Complete at least 1 of these Kubernetes administration courses:
  - Kubernetes Administration 1.2.6 (internal SUSE)
  - [This one on Udemy, recommended by a colleague]((https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/))
- Full migration from Notion to Anytype (open source)
  - Replicate the current structure, especially my project knowledge & project management tools
- Finish pending SUSE chores
  - There's a few things I'd like to wrap up in Hackweek
- Use some time to build my openSUSE server on an old Mac Pro case (only if I have some spare time)
  - Define the project/specs
  - Get parts
  - Prepare/modify case
  - Build
  - Set up OS/software

## Hackweek Day 1 - Set up a GitHub pages-hosted website

### Motivation

I used to maintain a personal WordPress blog for a long time, but I took it offline because I didn't have the time to maintain it. Recently, I started journaling, and I'm retaking my interest in writing.
Hackweek felt like an excellent opportunity to start writing again since I intend to track my progress in this blog.
But this time, I wanted something other than a WordPress blog with an already-made theme. I wanted to have something customizable and open source, and it also needed to have automated deployments. I wanted to host it in GitHub and leverage GitHub pages.

### Next.js

Before my recent adventures as a Project Manager, I worked as a UI Designer/Developer, working with many different frameworks over the years. One of them is React, which I am familiar with. Next.js is a React framework with extra goodies, such as static page generation. It was the right platform to work on for my use case.

### Choosing a template and customizing it

Due to time constraints, creating a theme from scratch was a bad idea. I went on to search for a template. There are plenty of closed-source templates for Next.js, but I needed one with an open-source license. Thankfully, I found the [Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) template, which uses Next.js and the Tailwind CSS framework. It's an excellent foundation for a customizable blog.
I went on to create a logo with Figma and customize the template a bit. I will add more tweaks to it soon, as it is currently vanilla.

### Hosting it on GitHub

Since Next.js generates statics sites quickly, setting it up for self-hosting was a breeze. I decided not to fork the project but just downloaded it and added it to a new repo. In hindsight, I should have forked it; my project would have diverged significantly from upstream. Time will tell!
Setting up Github pages and pointing a domain name to it is extremely easy. I use Cloudflare to handle DNSs, and I followed GitHub's guides to set everything up. Easy as pie!

### Automatic deployments

This was, again, extremely easy to set up. Github [has an action](https://github.com/jhmarina/zenon-blog/actions/workflows/nextjs.yml) to publish a Next.js site to GitHub Pages. All I had to do was follow the template's readme to tweak some things, and it worked! Whenever I merge a commit to the remote repository, it handles the deployment automatically.

### Conclusion

I am satisfied with the result. I have a blog hosted on GitHub; it's open-source and easily customizable. I did everything in a few hours, which allowed me to focus on other Hackweek projects. All in all, this is a success!

## Hackweek Day 2 & 3 - Kubernetes Administration Training

I will soon add progress! So far, I already joined [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/), which was recommended by a colleague, and started with it. I hope to finalize it in 2 days, but I may have to use Thursday for it, too. We'll see!
